aet - aniyomi extension tests

This repo runs automated tests on aniyomi extensions via github actions, and shows
its results in the [results](../results/README.md) branch.

Note that the results accuracy isn't 100% correct, showing false negatives for
sources that are ip-blocking github actions, or sources may require additional
configuration to work properly(like logins, specific settings or cookies).
