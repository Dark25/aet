The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.\n\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.\n\n*This includes following special episodes:\n- Chopperman to the Rescue! Protect the TV Station by the Shore! (Episode 336)\n- The Strongest Tag-Team! Luffy and Toriko's Hard Struggle! (Episode 492)\n- Team Formation! Save Chopper (Episode 542)\n- History's Strongest Collaboration vs. Glutton of the Sea (Episode 590)\n- 20th Anniversary! Special Romance Dawn (Episode 907)",

Banaza is one of those heroes, summoned from the Royal Capital Paluma, but something’s not right—Banaza is only an average merchant. He has no magic, no fighting ability, and his stats are abysmal. Worse, a mishap leaves him unable to return home! Rejected as a hero and stranded in another world, abandoned to the far reaches of the kingdom by a cruel king who just wants him gone, Banaza’s fate looks pretty bleak. But what will happen once the failed hero candidate finds himself with super cheat powers once he hits level two?\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good.

A continuation of the first 2 seasons under a new name, still adapting the online webcomics drawn by Himaruya Hidekaz.\n\nBased on a popular web-released manga series by Hidekazu Himaruya, this has been described as a \"cynical gag\" story set in Europe in the years between WW1 and WW2 (1915-1939), using exaggerated caricatures of the different nationalities as portrayed by a gaggle of bish&#333;nen. For example, the Italia Veneziano character is into pasta and women. The Deutsche (German) bishi loves potatoes and sausages, and Nippon is an otaku boy. Installments of the manga have jumped back and forth in setting from the ancient times to modern-day geopolitics. The manga's title comes the Japanese words for \"useless\" (hetare) and Italy (Italia).\n\n(Source: ANI)",

But the accidental destruction she wreaks on everything she touches &mdash;even with the exotic alloy restraints she wears&mdash; means she's constantly in debt.

After setting him free from the terror of his ruthless kidnapper his eternal gratitude will surely guarantee marriage &mdash;and an end to all her financial headaches. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ",
