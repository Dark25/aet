The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.\n*This includes following special episodes:\n- Chopperman to the Rescue! Protect the TV Station by the Shore! (Episode 336)\n- The Strongest Tag-Team! Luffy and Toriko's Hard Struggle! (Episode 492)\n- Team Formation!

Walking home from school one day she bumps into some guys, and even though it's an accident, they hassle her until she is saved by a mysterious man. His name is Ichiyou, and he is searching for Gods. Nozomu sends him along his way only to be approached by Tenkou, who is searching for his Master. Nozomu reunites Ichiyou and Tenkou; (and their abusive relationship), and gets a view of another world. The two men are on a journey to find the Gods. The world that was once supported by four evil Gods, has fallen to a crisis. Using song and dance, it is up to the kashikans to bring back the Gods which fled from their confinement…\n\nOther name(s): HAIGAKURA, ハイガクラ",
